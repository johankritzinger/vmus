# VMUS record capture

Based on the ionic 3 super starter template

The app is supposed to enable capture of records to submit to any of the VMUS
projects.

As such it needs to be able to work offline, allowing capturing of as much
as is convenient at the time, updating of records later and submitting
when a network connection is available.

The current version is not usable - it saves locally but does not export or submit
records.
